	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time a program takes to run as a function of the size of its input. An algorithm with better Time complexity is more efficient and performs faster for larger inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory used by an algorithm to execute and store data, including input values, variables, and auxiliary structures. The Space Complexity of an algorithm is often represented using notations like O(n).</p>
